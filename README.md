# CSDAG
This repository contains the code and data for the paper *"Dynamic Connectivity of Multi-Arousal Sentiment and Feedback Loops based on Complex Network Analysis"*.
All models are deployed on a remote server, with 2 RTX4090 GPUS. 

- **ABM.ipynb**: Implements the agent-based model (ABM) used in the paper, detailing the computational processes outlined in the manuscript.
- **Text_mining.ipynb**: Contains code for text processing and sentiment analysis.
- **Prediction.ipynb**: Includes the training and prediction code for modeling the transitions in node states.
- **Plot.ipynb**: Provides code for visualizing the results of the model simulations.

### Key Figures:
